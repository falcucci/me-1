# 2019.09 - Strangloop - Evolution of Infrastructure

## Abstract
Abstract: Infrastructure has come a long way from servers in closets ??. The servers are out of the closet and software defined in the cloud ??. They're so fabulous they're serverless ?. Now they're breaking all the rules and moving to the edge. Next thing you know they'll be everywhere and nowhere! Let's take a trip down memory lane and peek into the future ? for what infrastructure is blossoming into ? and how it impacts the software we write.
